                    My name is Ursanne Kengne, student at York University majoring in Computer Science. I am currently 20 years old. When young, I quickly realize my abilities and passion for the computer World and innovative technologies which brings to me to the conclusion to study Computer Science after graduating from High School. Willing to learn the best current software and hardware technologies, I decided to pursue my studies in Computer Science at York University, Canada.
                     I have research interest in software programming, improvement in the interaction of  databases between client and server in programming environments and analysis in improvement of algorithms using dynamic programming. In the course of my academic journey, I have set the goal to achieve a PHD thesis in data Science and artificial intelligence(AI).
                    
                    I invite you to discover my website to learn other aspects of me.
